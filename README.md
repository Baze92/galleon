Galleon
=======

A small app I'm working on to keep track of my daily expenses at college, because spreadsheets got too unwieldy after a while.

This is mostly just an experiment with [Meteor](http://meteor.com/). It's deployed at [galleon.meteor.com](http://galleon.meteor.com) but doesn't have any authentication support (yet) so you'll have to run it locally if you want to use it for yourself.
